LLMOA: A novel large language model assisted hyper-heuristic optimization algorithm  
Necessary packages: opfunu, scipy, and google.generativeai.

# Highlights  
• We propose a novel large language model assisted hyper-heuristic optimization algorithm.  
• The standard prompt engineering-guided Gemini is employed as the high-level component.  
• The low-level heuristics (LLHs) consist of ten well-designed search operators  
• Experiments on CEC2014, CEC2020, CEC2022, and 10 engineering problems are conducted.
